          </h1>
          <p class="lead">The Internet of things (IoT) is a system of interconnected computing devices,
            objects such as machine, animals or people that are provided with unique
            identifiers with the ability to transfer data over a network. Computing is being
            transformed to a model consisting of services that are commoditized and
            delivered in a manner similar to utilities such as water, electricity, gas, telephony,
            etc. In such a model, users access services based on their requirements without
            regard to where the services are hosted. Several computing paradigms have
            promised to deliver this utility-computing vision. Computing has emerged as one
            of the buzzwords in the IT industry and turned the vision of &quot;computing utilities&quot;
            into a reality. Several IT vendors have started offering computation, storage, and
            application hosting services, and provide coverage in several continents,
            supporting Service-Level Agreements (SLA) backed performance and uptime
            promises for their services. It leads to generates huge numbers of structure and
            unstructured data. Therefore, Enterprise and Big-Data applications need tools
            and platforms for their rapid construction and deployment on Clouds on-demand
            meeting user QoS requirements at lower price. This also helps in automation of
            the system in industry through Science and Technology and Engineering like;
            Instrumentation, IT, Mechatronic, Telecommunication, Electrical, among few
            others. However, by and large, companies fail to systematically collect, store,
            analyze and use such data to improve process efficiency or meet other goals.
            So, these data sets need to be analyzed using Machine learning concept that has
            experienced a boost in popularity among both academia and industry.
            This conference aims at providing an opportunity and platform to present and
            discuss recent advances in the field of IoT, Machine learning and Big data
            independently and also as a confluence of ideas.

        The ubiquitous IEEE 802.11 family of protocols has its genesis in the random access protocols of the
        early days of computer networks. The first protocols allowed for a peak bandwidth of 2Mbps. They have come a
        long way since then and Gbps rates are on the horizon. In the process, we also have an alphabet soup of
        variations. In this tutorial, we will trace the history of this protocol and understand the engineering choices
        that were made in designing them. We will also discuss the state of the art and the emerging standards and also
        see how they fit into the wireless world of 4G, 5G and beyond.

        <span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: larger;">Abstract:</span>
        Fog computing consists of modest capability fog nodes located close to users/data generation sources. These
        nodes are ideal for executing small interactive tasks with low latency requirements. Tasks that are larger and
        more latency tolerant may be executed at the cloud data center. In this talk, we discuss RT-SANE (Real-Time
        Security Aware scheduling on the Network Edge), a scheduling algorithm for real-time tasks on fog-cloud systems.
        RT-SANE supports both batch and interactive applications, taking account of their deadline and security
        constraints. RT-SANE chooses between a micro data center (in proximity to a user) and a cloud data center by
        taking account of network delay and security tags. We also discuss a fog computing based over-the-air (OTA)
        update algorithm for smart vehicles. We propose a mobility management algorithm that takes into account the
        mobility of smart vehicles. In order to reduce the number of handovers, an ILP formulation has also been
        proposed. Finally, we discuss a framework for repelling wild animals in the agricultural fields using fog
        computing.
